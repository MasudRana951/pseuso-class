                    CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is 
                    expressed by 
                    adding a colon (:) after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or "active", like this: a:hover { /* 
                    your 
                    style here */ }
                </p> <br><br>
                <h3>bottom is some examples</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    this text will change its color when you hover you cursor over it
                </p>
                <br><br>
